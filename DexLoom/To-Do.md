# DexLoom Master To-Do

## 1. Mission Definition

### What "Full APK Runner" Means
DexLoom aims to load Android APK files on jailed iOS and execute their Dalvik bytecode to the maximum extent technically feasible. This means:
- Parsing APK containers (ZIP with specific structure)
- Parsing AndroidManifest.xml (binary AXML format)
- Parsing resources.arsc (Android resource tables)
- Parsing and verifying DEX bytecode (Dalvik Executable format)
- Interpreting all 256 Dalvik opcodes with correct semantics
- Providing a compatibility layer for Android framework APIs (android.*, java.*, kotlin.*, androidx.*)
- Rendering Android UI layouts via SwiftUI translation
- Handling Activity lifecycle, user interaction, and state

### What "Supports Every Single APK" Would Imply
True universal support would require:
- A complete Java SE runtime library implementation
- A complete Android framework reimplementation (millions of lines of code in AOSP)
- JNI bridge capable of executing ARM ELF shared libraries (.so files)
- Binder IPC emulation for system services
- Linux kernel syscall translation layer
- OpenGL ES / Vulkan GPU pipeline translation
- Full threading with Java Memory Model semantics
- Content provider, broadcast receiver, and service lifecycle
- WebView (Chromium) equivalent

This is **not achievable** in full. The goal is to maximize the subset of APKs that produce meaningful output.

### Jailed iOS Constraints
- **No JIT compilation**: All code must be interpreted or ahead-of-time compiled before distribution
- **No unsigned native code execution**: Cannot dlopen arbitrary .so files extracted from APKs
- **Sandbox restrictions**: Limited filesystem access, no /proc, no ptrace, no fork
- **No background execution model matching Android**: iOS suspends apps aggressively
- **Graphics stack mismatch**: No OpenGL ES context sharing, no SurfaceFlinger, no Hardware Composer
- **No Binder IPC**: Android's fundamental IPC mechanism does not exist
- **No Linux kernel**: No /dev, /sys, /proc, no Android-specific syscalls
- **Memory pressure**: iOS kills background apps; Android expects more headroom

### What "Production-Grade" Means
- Parsers reject malformed input without crashing
- Runtime failures are contained and reported, never silently corrupt state
- Performance is acceptable for interactive use (sub-second layout inflation, <100ms UI updates)
- Test coverage exists for all critical paths
- Diagnostics allow debugging APK failures without source access
- The codebase is maintainable by engineers who did not write it

## 6. Simplified or Placeholder Implementation Debt

### ~~Fake Parse Success~~ [FIXED]
- ~~**Manifest SDK version extraction**: Fields exist in DxManifest but never populated.~~ [FIXED] minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion now extracted from uses-sdk tag.
- ~~**App label extraction**: Field exists but returns NULL.~~ [FIXED] android:label now extracted from application tag.

### ~~Hardcoded Values~~ [FIXED]
- ~~**System.currentTimeMillis() returns 0**~~: [FIXED] Now returns actual wall clock time.
- ~~**SharedPreferences returns default values**~~: [FIXED] In-memory key-value store with Editor put/get/commit/apply (256 entries).

### ~~Demo-Only Resource Substitution~~ [FIXED]
- ~~**ImageView placeholder**~~: [FIXED] Now loads actual PNG/JPEG from APK res/drawable-* via dx_ui_extract_drawable.
- ~~**RecyclerView as VStack**~~: [FIXED] Real adapter pattern with getItemCount/onCreateViewHolder/onBindViewHolder dispatch.

### Non-Validating Readers
- **DEX bytecode trusted without verification**: Malformed bytecode could read out of bounds on code[], corrupt register state, or infinite loop. **Dangerous** for untrusted APKs. **Fix**: Add verification pass.
- **ZIP entries trusted without CRC validation**: Corrupt data passes silently. **Fix**: Validate CRC32.

### Logging-Only Execution Paths
- ~~**Handler.post() is a no-op**~~: [FIXED] Now executes Runnables synchronously.
- ~~**ViewGroup.addView() is a no-op**~~: [FIXED] Now creates DxUINode and attaches to parent tree, triggers render model rebuild.

### Unsupported Features Silently Ignored
- **monitor-enter/exit no-ops**: Synchronized blocks compile to these opcodes. Code inside runs regardless, which is correct for single-threaded, but apps relying on synchronization for correctness may exhibit wrong behavior.
- **Networking stubs return simulated 200 responses**: HttpURLConnection returns stub InputStream; no real data. Apps that depend on network data will show empty/default content. **Fix**: Bridge to URLSession for real networking.

## 7. Optimization and Scaling Backlog

### Parser Performance
- [ ] Memory-map APK file instead of reading entire file into memory
- [ ] Lazy DEX string table: only decode strings when accessed
- [ ] Cache parsed layout XML by resource ID (avoid re-parsing)
- [ ] Cache parsed class data by class_def index

### Interpreter Performance
- [ ] Computed goto dispatch table (threaded interpreter)
- [ ] Pin hot registers in local C variables within interpreter loop
- [ ] Inline caching for monomorphic call sites (invoke-virtual)
- [ ] Superinstruction combining (e.g., iget + return-object → single dispatch)
- [ ] Method inlining for trivial getters/setters (field access + return)

### Memory Efficiency
- [x] Frame pool: 64-frame pool eliminates malloc/free per method call
- [ ] String intern hash table (replace linear scan for >1000 strings)
- [x] Class lookup hash table: FNV-1a O(1) lookup (DX_CLASS_HASH_SIZE=4096)
- [ ] Field slot precomputation (store slot index at class load, avoid name lookup at runtime)
- [ ] NaN-boxing for DxValue (reduce from 16 bytes to 8 bytes per register)
- [ ] Arena allocator for parse-time allocations (DEX strings, type IDs)

### UI Performance
- [ ] Diff-based render model: only serialize changed nodes
- [ ] Throttle render model updates to 16ms intervals
- [ ] Lazy child expansion for large view hierarchies (>100 nodes)
- [ ] View recycling for RecyclerView

### Benchmarking
- [ ] Create benchmark APK with known instruction count
- [ ] Measure opcodes-per-second on simulator
- [ ] Measure GC pause duration
- [ ] Measure APK parse time for 10MB, 50MB, 100MB APKs
- [ ] Measure layout inflation time for 10, 50, 200 node layouts

## 8. Production Hardening Backlog

- [ ] **Crash isolation**: Install signal handlers for SIGSEGV/SIGBUS; report error instead of crashing app
- [ ] **Memory pressure handling**: Register for iOS memory warnings; trigger aggressive GC
- [ ] **Watchdog**: Detect interpreter stuck for >10 seconds; abort with diagnostic
- [ ] **UI freeze prevention**: Run interpreter on background thread; bridge results to main thread
- [ ] **Deterministic diagnostics**: On any DxResult error, capture: method name, pc, opcode, register snapshot
- [ ] **Large APK resilience**: Stream-process APKs >50MB instead of loading to memory
- [ ] **Corruption resistance**: Validate all pointer dereferences in interpreter hot path
- [ ] **Graceful unsupported features**: When an APK uses unsupported features, present user-facing message listing what's missing
- [ ] **Release gating criteria**: Define minimum test pass rate (e.g., 95% of test suite) before release
- [ ] **Telemetry**: Optional opt-in crash/compatibility reporting

---

## 9. Research Backlog

- [ ] **[RESEARCH] JNI on jailed iOS**: Can ARM user-mode emulation (Unicorn) execute simple .so JNI methods with acceptable performance? Benchmark.
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] Partial Linux API emulation**: How many Android-used syscalls can be stubbed on iOS? Which ones cause real failures?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] Jetpack Compose feasibility**: Could a Compose compiler output translator generate SwiftUI? (Likely no, but worth studying the IR.)
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] WebView via WKWebView**: Can android.webkit.WebView be bridged to WKWebView for basic page loads? JavaScript bridge?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] Canvas → Core Graphics**: Map Android Canvas draw calls to CGContext. What subset is feasible?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] invoke-custom / LambdaMetafactory**: Can lambda desugaring be done at DEX load time instead of runtime?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] Split APK support**: Parse split_config.*.apk and merge resources. How complex is the merge?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] AOT compilation**: Could a DEX-to-C translator generate compilable C source for hot methods?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] Dynamic proxy**: Can Proxy.newProxyInstance be implemented by generating DxClass/DxMethod at runtime?
- [ ] **[RESEARCH] App compatibility database**: Crowdsourced database of APK → compatibility status for user guidance

---

## 12. Done Criteria

A task may be marked done when ALL of the following are true:

1. **Real functionality exists**: The feature performs its documented purpose, not just a placeholder or log message.

2. **No placeholder logic**: No hardcoded return values, no "TODO" in the path, no demo-only behavior.

3. **Malformed input handling**: If the feature processes external input (APK data, DEX bytecode, user interaction), it handles malformed input without crashing and produces a useful error.

4. **Tests exist**: At least one unit or integration test validates the feature's correctness. For parsers: one positive and one negative test. For interpreter opcodes: one execution test.

5. **Diagnostics exist**: Failures produce log messages with enough information to diagnose the issue (method name, offset, expected vs actual).

6. **Performance is acceptable**: The feature does not introduce visible lag (>100ms) for typical inputs. Parse operations complete in reasonable time for realistic file sizes.

7. **Unsupported behavior is explicit**: If the feature cannot handle certain inputs (e.g., an unsupported resource type), it logs a clear warning rather than silently returning wrong results.

8. **Memory is managed**: All allocations have corresponding frees. No leaks on the normal path. GC integration is correct (objects are roots if needed).

9. **Code review passed**: Another engineer (or AI agent) has read the implementation and confirmed it matches the specification.

10. **Documentation updated**: If the feature changes public API surface, header comments and relevant docs are updated.
